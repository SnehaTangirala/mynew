        <h1><strong>Day Care:</strong></h1>
        <p>Daycare at Dogs Day Care is a daily hot spot for dogs, giving you a great way to get dogs out of the house for fun and socialization. Playgroups are formed based on size, temperament, and personality.</p>
        <p>Energetic games of fetch, tug-of-war (with our more mild-mannered guests), and unique playground equipment help dogs socialize with their daycare friends. Dogs Day Care keeps an active social calendar of structured play time so guests remain interested, engaged and exercised. All grooming clients receive complimentary daycare during their visit to ensure that they’ll never be bored!</p>
        <h1><strong>Boarding:</strong></h1>
        <p>We have designed our pet accommodations to provide tranquil, first-class suites with all the luxuries of home or a high-end resort. Pillow-top mattresses encased in plush bedding will envelope your dog for sweet puppy dreams. Each guest gets turn-down service at bedtime with a treat and a wake-up call each morning and a scratch behind the ears.</p>
        <p>Plus, boarding stays include daycare or one-on-one play therapy so your dog gets active exercise throughout the day.</p>
        <h1><strong>Spa:</strong></h1>
        <p>Ask any dog parent and they will tell you that bath time at home can be an ordeal that leaves everyone involved stressed out and the bathroom a mess. It can also leave a trail of hair and water through your house if your dog shakes off frequently following a bath.</p>
        <p>Dogs Day Care Spa and grooming services include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shampoo and conditioner</li>
          <li>Nail trim</li>
          <li>Fluff dry and brush out</li>
          <li>Teeth brushing</li>
          <li>Ear cleaning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our dog care professionals don’t watch the clock and will provide frequent rest breaks if your dog requires. They are highly attentive to your dog’s needs. We also allow their parents to stay with them through the process if it makes either of them feel more comfortable.</p>
